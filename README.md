# Events Calendar in React & Rails

Save events to your Monthly Calendar. Calendar built using RESTful API architecture in RAILS. User is able to make a get, put, post & delete request to API. More features coming soon! :neckbeard:

### App in Ruby Rails:
This App is a refactored from a previous Node.JS application that I built. [Check out the original repo here](https://github.com/natashaU/events_calendar). I decided to practice Ruby on Rails and I cloned my original app to use the frontend I built in React. I changed the Remote Repo with  `git remote set-url origin` so that the original repo remains intact. I deleted the entire backend in Node.JS and changed the backend to Ruby on Rails â€” and I built the new backend in rails from scratch. 


## Heroku Deployment
